Array Intersection Bake-off

One of those moments where an interview question turns into a research
project, or is it really a bake off?  The simple problem is demonstrate
an algorithm to intersect two lists of numbers, fundamentally it's
question about using modern interpreted languages and their associative
array bits to make a simple intersection routine.  However many languages
support many different ways to do things.  I've put together a test
of Python vs. Java vs. Ruby vs. Perl vs. PHP and got a few interesting
benchmarks.
